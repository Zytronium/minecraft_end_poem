# Minecraft End Poem Recreation
Web version

This is a faithful recreation of Minecraft's end poem that plays after you beat the game,
minus the credits. No video, no gif, just normal web-based construction.  Contains a 
repeating png background, a start button, some scrolling text, music by C418, and a bit 
of CSS styling. Fullscreen it and there's practically no difference from the real thing. 
Just click start, lay back, and relax.
